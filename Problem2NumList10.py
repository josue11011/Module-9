# Problem #2: : create a list called L that contains the numbers 0 to 10 then create a while loop to append
# current value then the while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 10.

#def check_nums(list):
#    i = 0
#    New_list = []
#    while i < 10:
#        if list[i] > 10:
#            break
#        New_list.append(list[i])
#        i = i + 1
#    return New_list

def check_nums():
    counter = 0
    New_list = []
    while counter <= 10:
        New_list.append(i)
        counter += 1
    print(New_list)

#L = [0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10]
#L should be created during the iteration
#list = L: No need to change name 
#print(check_nums(list))
print(check_nums())
